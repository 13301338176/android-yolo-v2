# Android YOLOv2 with tensorflow mobile
This android application uses YOLOv2 model for object detection. It uses tensorflow mobile to run neural networks, later I would like to use tensorflow lite.
I started from the [tensorflow-mobile](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/#0) example project.
